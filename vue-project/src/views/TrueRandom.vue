      <h1>True Random Number Generation</h1>
      <p>True random number generation is the process of generating numbers that are truly random and unpredictable. These numbers are not based on any deterministic algorithm and are instead generated using physical processes that are inherently random, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay.</p>
      <p>True random number generation is important in many applications, particularly in cryptography and other security-sensitive areas. It is also used in scientific simulations, where the unpredictability of the generated numbers is important for accurate results.</p>
      <h2>How True Random Number Generation Works</h2>
      <p>True random number generators typically use physical processes to generate random numbers. For example, a hardware random number generator might use atmospheric noise or radioactive decay to generate random bits. These bits are then combined to create random numbers.</p>
      <p>True random number generators can also be implemented using software algorithms, but these algorithms must rely on sources of entropy to generate truly random numbers. Entropy sources might include mouse movements, keyboard presses, or microphone input.</p>
      <h2>Advantages of True Random Number Generation</h2>
      <p>The main advantage of true random number generation is that the generated numbers are truly random and unpredictable. This makes them suitable for use in cryptography and other security-sensitive applications where the randomness and unpredictability of the generated numbers is crucial. True random number generation can also be useful in scientific simulations, where the unpredictability of the generated numbers is important for accurate results.</p>
